Future possibility of extension: For the easy integration of future external APIs without altering existing logic, defined an interface ExchangeRateProviderInterface.php. Each provider- MoneyNowProvider.php and FinanceMagicProvider.php - implementsÂ ExchangeRateProviderInterface interface. This way, additional providers can be added by updating the factory, without changing existing implementation.

Caching: Implemented a CachingDecorator.php that wraps any provider to cache its responses. Currently, MoneyNowProvider is cached while FinanceMagicProvider is not, to incorporate the requirement that some services may not require caching.

Logging: To track which provider is used and where the data is sourced from. This logging logic is reusable across providers.

Currency value Formatting: Introduced CurrencyRate.php to ensure exchange rates are formatted to two decimal places as per requirement.

Each class follows the Single Responsibility Principle and is organized following a clean and standard PHP folder structure for better readability and maintainability.
Single File Version (as in requirement doc): Since the requirement also mentions submission in a single file, I have included a version in exchange_rate_api.php.

To test the structured version: php index.php
To test the single file version: php exchange_rate_api.php
